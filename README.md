BIB
===

BIB is a framework built on [Box2D](http://box2d.org) ([box2d-html5](https://code.google.com/p/box2d-html5/)) and [IvanK Lib](http://lib.ivank.net).

BIB enables rapid experimentation and prototyping of Box2D scenarios. It provides declarative specification of the Box2D b2Body and handles their initialization. IvanK Lib is used to draw sprites for each b2Body to a WebGL canvas.

Details on using BIB is available in app/examples.

The library is packaged as a Chrome App, which can also be downloaded [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bib/clpbnigmledbhmjepnjjkbmaklgbhjhe).
